<!-- This is a comment, in between these two sets of symbols -->

<!-- html is hypertext markup language -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- every webpage starts with the above line -->
<!-- html includes tags
	an <opening-tag> inside of angle bracket
    and usually a </closing-tag> -- also has a slash after the opening bracket -->

<html>
	<head>	<!-- The head section is meta-data about your web page -->
		<title>My First Web Page</title>
	</head>
	<body bgcolor="tan">	<!-- This is where the content of your web page goes -->
		<!-- Change the background color of this page using a HEX color. Ctl-Shift-P
		 then type 'color picker' -->

		<!-- Now, let's add a large centered headline -->
		<h1>All About Me</h1>

		<!-- Let's put some text in a paragraph -->
		<p>This is some text. It is in my first paragraph. Blah Blah Blah. And another blah.</p>

		<!-- the headline goes from h1 (largest) down to h6 (smallest). -->
		<!-- medium headline -->
		<h3> GT student description</h3>

		<!-- Add an image of yourself to your web page.  -->
		<img src="buzz1.jpg">
		<!-- src is an attribute and its value is "buzz1.jpg"
		 Be sure to put your image files in the same folder as index.html -->

		<p>Here is a second paragaph.<br>And more after a line break.</p>
		<!-- Note that <br> does NOT have a closing tag unlike most other tags -->

		<!-- let's add a link to another page -->
		<!-- the link tag is <a> and the attribute for the webpage is href -->
